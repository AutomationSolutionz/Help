### 2. Defect

A **Defect** refers to any flaw or issue in a software application that deviates from its intended behavior or specifications.

### 3. Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

**CMM** in software testing stands for **Capability Maturity Model**, which is a framework used to evaluate and improve the maturity and effectiveness of an organizations's software development and testing processes. It provides a set of best practices and guidelines for organizations to enhance their software development and testing capabilities.

### 4. Beta Testing

**Beta Testing** is the final testing phase where a select group of external users evaluates the software in a real-world environment to uncover potential issues before its official release.

### 5. Black Box Testing

**Black Box Testing** is a method where the internal structure and logic of the system are not known to the tester, focusing solely on input and output behavior.

### 6. Bottom-Up Testing

**Bottom-Up Testing** is a software testing approach that begins by testing individual components or modules of a system first and then gradually integrates and tests them in a hierarchial manner, moving up towards the complete system. This method ensures that each component works correctly before combining them into larger units or the entire application.

### 7. Boundary Testing

**Boundary Testing** is a software testing technique that focuses on the boundaries or limits of input values in a program or system. It aims to check how the software behaves when inputs are at the extreme edges or just beyond the acceptable range.

### 8. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

**Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** is a software testing technique used to identify defects or issues at the boundaries of input domains. It focuses on testing values that are at the edges or just outside the valid ranges for input data.  

For example, if a software component accepts integers between 1 and 100, a boundary value analysis would involve testing values such as:  
* 1 (The *Lower* Boundary)
* 100 (The *Upper* Boundary)
* 2 (Just inside the *Lower* Boundary)
* 99 (Just inside the *Upper* Boundary)
* 0 (Just outside the *Lower* Boundary)
* 101 (Just outside the *Upper* Boundary).

### 9. Branch Testing

**Branch Testing** is a white-box software testing technique that evaluates individual branches or decision points in a program's source code to ensure all possible to ensure all possible outcomes are tested.

### 10. Coding

It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, enabling the integration of diverse software systems and services.  
APIs are fundamental in modern software development, facilitating the development of software components, web services, and the interaction between applications, platforms, and devices.

### 19. What is the meaning of Automated Software Quality (ASQ)?

**Automated Software Quality (ASQ)** refers to the use of automated tools, processes, and techniques to assess and ensure the quality of software throughout its development lifecycle. This includes automating various testing activities such as functional testing, regression testiong, performance testing, and more.

### 20. What is the meaning of Automated Testing?

**Automated Testing** is a software testing technique in which the execution of test cases, including the setup, execution, and evaluation of results, is automated using testing tools or scripts. It allows for the repetitive and systematic testing of software applications, improving efficiency and reliability in the testing process.

### 21. Binary Portability Testing

**Binary Portability Testing** is a vital aspect of software testing, ensuring that compiled software or binary files can function smoothly across diverse hardware and operating system setups. It assesses compatibility with various processor architectures, operating systems like (Windows, Linux, or macOS), and hardware configurations. This type of testing aims to identify and resolve issues related to hardware differences, operating system variations, version compatibility, and file format differences.

### 22. Breadth Testing

**Breadth Testing**, also known as breadth-first testing, is a software testing approach that focuses on examining a wide range of features or functionalities in a shallow and comprehensive manner. In breadth testing, the primary objective is to ensure that the basic functionalities of the software or application are working correctly across different areas rather than diving deeply into specific features.

### 23. Cause Effect Graph

A **Cause Effect Graph** is a graphical representation used to depict the logical relationships between inputs (causes) and output (effects) in a system. It is technique commonly used in test case design to systematically generate test cases based on the various combinations of input conditions.

### 24. Code Coverage

**Code Coverage** measures how much of the code is executed by test cases, helping assess testing comprehensiveness.

### 25. Code Inspection

**Code Inspection**, also know as code review, is a systematic examination of source code by software developers to find and fix defects, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards and design guidelines. It is a manual and collaborative process that helps identify issues early in the development cycle, leading to higher software reliability and maintainability.

End-to-End testing is typically conducted as a final quality check before software release to guarantee that it meets user requirements and functions smoothly across the entire system.

### 31. Exhaustive Testing

**Exhaustive Testing**, also known as complete testing or brute force testing, is software testing technique where every possible input or combination of inputs for a given software application is tested. The goal is to ensure that the software is free from defects under all potential scenarios.   
Exhaustive testing is rarely used in practice, and testers typically employ their testing methods, such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, to focus on critical and representative test cases.

### 32. Functional Testing

**Functional Testing** is a critical aspect of software testing, focusing on evaluating whether a software application meets its intended functionality. This type of testing involves testing the software's features, inputs, outputs, and behavior based on predefined requirements. Testers use valid and invalid inputs to check how the software responds and verify that all features work correctly.

### 33. Grey Box Testing

**Grey Box Testing** is a hybrid software testing method that combines elements of both black box and white box testing. Testers conducting grey box tests have limited knowledge of the software's internal workings, such as its code structure, but not full access to the source code. They use this partial understanding to design test cases that evaluate the software's functionality, security, and integration points. This approach strikes a balance between the black box method, which lacks insight into the software's architecture, and white box testing, which requires in-depth knowledge of the code.

### 34. Higher Order Testing
