title: Variables and Indexed Access
---

With Zeuz Node, you can store complex variables of any common type - integers, floats, strings, lists and dictionaries. You can even nest lists and dictionaries inside each other as much as you like and then later access them very easily with the indexed syntax that is very similar to Python or most other language's array access syntax using `[ ]`.

TBD.
