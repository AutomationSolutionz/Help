## Description
Security actions are measures taken to protect systems, networks, applications, or data from unauthorized access, exploitation, or disruption. These include authentication methods like passwords or multi-factor authentication, authorization to manage user permissions, encryption to secure data, and tools like vulnerability scanners to identify system weaknesses. Additional actions include patch management, intrusion detection, access control, incident response, audits for compliance, and backup procedures to prevent data loss. Together, these actions ensure the security and integrity of systems and data.

## Examples of Security actions

### 1. **Nikto**
**Nikto** is an open-source web server scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security issues in web servers. It performs comprehensive tests to identify problems such as outdated software versions, default files, insecure configurations, and other potential threats. With support for plugins, Nikto can detect specific vulnerabilities and perform scans on SSL/TLS-enabled servers. Additionally, it allows users to customize tests based on their needs. Commonly used by penetration testers and security professionals. Nikto helps assess the security posture of web servers and ensures compliance with best practices by identifying and addressing security flaws.

### 2. **Nmap**
**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover devices, services, and open ports within a network. This action involves running Nmap scans to gather information about a target system, such as available hosts, their IP addresses, operating systems, and active services. It can perform various types of scans, including TCP, UDP, and OS detection, to identify vulnerabilities or security risks. Nmap is widely used for network auditing, security assessments, and troubleshooting network issues.

### 3. **Wapiti**
**Wapiti** is a web application vulnerability scanner used to assess the security of web applications. This action scans a target web application for vulnerabilities by analyzing pages, forms, and inputs without altering the application's state. It identifies potential issues such as SQL manipulation, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and other common vulnerabilities. Wapiti does not rely on a signature database but instead uses various techniques to detect weaknesses, making it suitable for dynamic security assessments.
