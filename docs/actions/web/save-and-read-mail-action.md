The two images provide information on enabling **IMAP/POP** access in Gmail and setting up app passwords, which are necessary for secure access to Gmail from external applications.

## Image 1: **Gmail Settings - Forwarding and POP/IMAP**

This image shows the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** settings in Gmail:

 1. **Forwarding**: Users can add a forwarding address to automatically send incoming emails to another email address. This feature is configured by clicking "Add a forwarding address".

 2. **POP Download**:
 - **Status**: The POP status shows as enabled, meaning the user can download emails using the POP protocol.
 - **Options**:
   - **Enable POP for all mail**: Downloads all emails, including those already accessed.
   - **Enable POP for mail that arrives from now on**: Downloads only new emails received after enabling POP.
   - **Disable POP**: Turns off POP access.
 - **Message Handling**: Users can choose what Gmail should do with messages accessed via POP, such as keeping a copy in the Inbox or marking them as read.

 3. **IMAP Access**:
 - **Status**: IMAP is enabled, allowing access from other clients.
 - **Options**:
   - **Enable IMAP**: Enables IMAP access for syncing emails across multiple devices.
   - **Disable IMAP**: Turns off IMAP access.
- **Auto-Expunge Settings**: Controls whether deleted messages are immediately updated on the server or held until the client initiates the update.
- **Deleted Messages Handling**: Options include archiving, moving to Trash, or permanently deleting messages that are marked as deleted.

These settings are essential for configuring email clients and third-party apps to interact with Gmail through POP or IMAP protocols.

## Image 2: **App Passwords - Google Account**
This image shows the **App Passwords** section in a Google account, used when two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled:

 1. **App Passwords List**: The user has created multiple app-specific passwords for different applications, such as, "bbtest", "test new", and "mail". Each entry shows when the app password was created and last used. These passwords allow access to Gmail without needing the primary account password, adding a layer of security.

 2. **Creating a New App Password**:
 - Users can enter a custom name for a new app-specific password in the "App name" field. After naming it and clicking "Create", a unique password is generated, which can then be used in email clients or third-party applications.

 3. **App Password Usage**: App passwords are useful when using third-party applications that require access to Gmail, especially when two-factor authentication is enabled, as they provide a way to grant access without compromising the main account credentials.

 However, the following images collectively guide users through enabling IMAP for Gmail access and generating app passwords for secure access by external applications, especially when 2FA is active.
