- **Drivers**: requests(python)

These actions are used to perform REST or API automation. You can combine loops, conditionals, result manipulation (lists, dictionaries, ...), variables and even actions of different platforms to create sophisticated test scenarios emulating real world usage of APIs. As an example, you can call an API endpoint and store the result in a variable, and then open a mobile app to get data from the UI to match - UI data against the stored result, all in a single test case!
