### What is the importance of the Document in software testing?

Documentation is highly important in software testing due to its role in ensuring clarity, consistency, traceability, knowledge transfer, and compliance. It helps testers and stakeholders understand the testing process, maintain consistency in practices, and establish traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects.  

Documentation supports knowledge sharing, assists in test maintenance and regression testing, and provides evidence for compliance and audits. It facilitates effective communication, decision-making, and transparency among team members.
