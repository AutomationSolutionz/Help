## Description

### What is the meaning of Branch in software testing?

In software testing, a **Branch** refers to a specific path or alternative flow within the software's source code. Branches occur when the code contains conditional statements (such as, if-else or switch-case) that lead to different outcomes or actions based on certain conditions. Each **Branch** represents a different set of instructions or behaviour that the software can follow depending on the conditions met during runtime.

Testing different **Branches** is crucial to ensure that the software functions correctly and handles various scenarios accurately. Test cases are designed to cover each branch, validating the expected behaviour and identifying any potential issues or defects. 

**Branch** coverage is a metric used to measure the percentage of branches exercised by the executed tests.

### Why Branch is necessary in software testing?

**Branches** are necessary in software testing for comprehensive coverage, accurate decision-making, error detection, risk mitigation, compliance adherence, and code quality improvement.

Testing different branches ensures that the software handles various scenarios correctly and identifies potential issues or defects. By exercising each branch , testers can validate the software's logic, detect errors, and reduce the risk of bugs in production.

**Branch** testing also helps meet regulatory requirements and improves code quality by identifying areas that may require refactoring or simplification. Overall, testing branches is essential for ensuring reliable and high-quality software.

### What is the meaning of Version in software testing?

In software testing, a **Version** refers to a specific release or iteration of the software. It represents a distinct state of the software at a particular point in time, marked by changes, enhancements, or bug fixes. Each **Version** has a unique identifier and is tested to ensure its functionality, performance, and stability.

**Versions** help to track the software's evolution, enable efficient bug tracking, and assist in managing software releases. They provide reference points for communication, allowing stakeholders to identify and discuss specific versions.

Overall, **Versions** in software testing help manage and track the different iterations of the software throughout its development cycle.

### What is the relation between Branch and Version in software testing?

**Versions** and **Branches** have a relationship in software testing. **Versions** represent specific releases or iterations of the software, indicating distinct states marked by changes and improvements.

On the other hand, **Branches** represent different paths or alternative flows within the source code, leading to various outcomes based on conditions. Different branches may be associated with different versions as developers work on specific features or bug fixes. Once a **Branch** is tested and merged into the main codebase, it contributes to a new **Version** of the software. Managing this relationship ensures a structured development process and maintains software quality across different version.

## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Project** then **Version** option.
