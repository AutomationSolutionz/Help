## Description

### Why Test Set is deployed? 

Test sets are deployed to ensure that the software application/product is tested thoroughly and meet the requirements before it is released into production.  
Automated testing is a process that validates if software is functioning appropriately and meeting requirements before it is released into production. This software testing method uses scripted sequences that are executed by testing tools.  
Automated testing tools execute examinations of the software, report outcomes and compare results with expected behaviour.  

### Why is it necessary to deploy a Test Set?

Deploying a Test Set is necessary in software testing because it allows you to deploy test sets to different environments. This can help to ensure that tests are run consistently across different environments and that any issues are detected as soon as possible.  
Test Set deployment can also help to reduce time and effort required to run tests manually. It can be used to deploy tests overnight or during weekends when there are fewer users on the system.  
Test Set deployment is an essential part of the software testing process and can help to ensure that your software is of high quality.
