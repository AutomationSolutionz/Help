## Description

### What is the deployment of a Test Set?  

The deployment of a Test Set involves running a collection of related test cases as a cohesive unit. It begins with selecting the appropriate test set based on testing objectives. The test environment is then set up, and the test set is executed by running each test case. Results and any encountered issues are recorded, and defects are tracked for resolution. Finally, the test set results are evaluated to assess system quality.  

The deployment of a test set ensures through testing, identifies and resolve defects, and contributes to the overall readiness of the software or system for release.  

### Why Test Set is deployed? 

Test sets are deployed to ensure that the software application/product is tested thoroughly and meet the requirements before it is released into production.  

Automated testing is a process that validates if software is functioning appropriately and meeting requirements before it is released into production. This software testing method uses scripted sequences that are executed by testing tools.  

Automated testing tools execute examinations of the software, report outcomes and compare results with expected behaviour.  

### Why is it necessary to deploy a Test Set?

Deploying a Test Set is necessary in software testing because it allows you to deploy test sets to different environments. This can help to ensure that tests are run consistently across different environments and that any issues are detected as soon as possible.  

Test Set deployment can also help to reduce time and effort required to run tests manually. It can be used to deploy tests overnight or during weekends when there are fewer users on the system.  

Test Set deployment is an essential part of the software testing process and can help to ensure that your software is of high quality.
