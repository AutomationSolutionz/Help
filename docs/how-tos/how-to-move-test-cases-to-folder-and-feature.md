## Description 

### Why is it necessary to move Test Cases to Folder?  

Moving test cases to folders are necessary for several reasons like:

* Firstly, it helps with organization and structure. By grouping test cases into folders, it provides a logical arrangement that makes it easier to locate and manage them.

* Secondly, it aids in test case management. Test cases can be categorized, sorted, and filtered based on specific criteria, making them easier to track and maintain.

* Thirdly, it facilitates test suite creation. Test cases within folders can be grouped together to create test suites, which are collections of related test cases. This simplifies test planning and execution.

Additionally, moving test cases to folders supports test case reusability, collaboration and sharing among team members, version control and overall efficiency in managing the testing process.  

### Why is it necessary to move Test Cases to Feature?  

Moving test cases into test case features are necessary for several reasons like:

* Firstly, it improves test case organization by grouping them based on specific features or functionalities. This enhances efficiency in managing and locating test cases.

* Secondly, it enhances test case traceability by aligning them with corresponding requirements or user stories. It ensures comprehensive testing and identifies any gaps in coverage.

* Thirdly, it enables a targeted testing approach, allowing testers to focus on specific features during testing. This improves test coverage and issue identification. 

Additionally, it simplifies test case maintenance, facillitates collaboration, and enhances test planning and execution. Overall, organizing test cases into features improve efficiency, traceability and effectiveness in testing.
