## Description

### What is the deployment of a Test Set?  

The deployment of a **Test Set** involves running a collection of related test cases as a cohesive unit. It begins with selecting the appropriate test set based on testing objectives. The test environment is then set up, and the test set is executed by running each test case. Results and any encountered issues are recorded, and defects are tracked for resolution. Finally, the test set results are evaluated to assess system quality.  

The deployment of a **Test Set** ensures through testing, identifies and resolve defects, and contributes to the overall readiness of the software or system for release.  

### Why Test Set is deployed? 

**Test Sets** are deployed to ensure that the software application/product is tested thoroughly and meet the requirements before it is released into production.  

Automated testing is a process that validates if software is functioning appropriately and meeting requirements before it is released into production. This software testing method uses scripted sequences that are executed by testing tools.  

Automated testing tools execute examinations of the software, report outcomes and compare results with expected behaviour.  


## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Testing** then **Set** option.

2. Go to the **Test Set** page.  
   > Here, the *Test Set* page contains a tab named **All**.  
A *Test Set* page is a dedicated page that organizes and manages a collection of related test cases, providing an overview and allowing for efficient execution and tracking of multiple tests.  

   > The All tab shows the Search Set option and the Sets which will be searched on Search Set bar.

3. Click on the **Deploy** button of the required **Test Case**.
   > The function of *Deploy* button in a test set is to initiate the execution of all the test cases within the set, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage and result generation.

4. Go to the **Run Tests/Deploy** page.  
   > The "Run Tests/Deploy" page in refers to a dedicated interface or platform where test cases are executed or deployed for the purpose of evaluating software functionality and performance.  

   > The *Run Tests/Deploy* page conatain two tabs:
    * **Deployment**
    * **Environment**.  

   > The informations of *Deployment* tab needs to be filled up.

5. Click on the **RUN** button.
   > The function of the *RUN* button is to start the execution of all test cases within the set, allowing for a streamlined and automated testing process.

6. Select the **Machine**.
7. Click on the **Deploy** button.
   > Selecting a machine to *Deploy* a test set is necessary to ensure the test set is executed in the desired environment, acurately reflecting the conditions in which the software will be used.
