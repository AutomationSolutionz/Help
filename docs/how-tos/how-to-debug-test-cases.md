## Description

### What is Debugging in automated test cases and Why is it necessary?

Debugging in automated test cases is the process of identifying and removing errors from software applications using automated testing tools.

Debugging is necessary because it helps to identify and fix defects in the system.

Debugging is crucial for writing clean code, minimizing errors, and creating top-quality software as a result. Any successful program requires hours of debugging to make it behave as expected.

## Steps

1. Go from the **View/Edit Test Case** and click on the **DEBUG** button.

   > The *DEBUG* button is a feature in software development tools that allows developers to pause program execution at specific points, inspect variables, and step through code to identify and fix issues.

2. Go to the **Debug Test Case** page.  
3. Click on **Select Machine** to select the required machine.  
   > Selecting a machine for debugging test cases is necessary to ensure compatability, reproduce issues, accurately investigate and fix bugs specific to the target environment.

4. There are **two** types of step selection  
5. Either select **All the steps** of the test case or select any **Required steps** that needs to be debug.  

6. Click to **Select All Steps** for the selection of all steps.
