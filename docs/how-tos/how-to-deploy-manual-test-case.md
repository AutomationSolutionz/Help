## Description

### What is a manual test case?

A manual test case is a test case that is executed manually by a tester without using any automated tools.  
The purpose of manual testing is to identify the bugs, issues and defects in the software application.  
Manual test cases are used to check the functionality of a system. Test cases can include checking the results of entering valid and invalid user IDs and password.  
Another example of a manual test is creating a to-do list and checking that all fields are filled in correctly and the newly created listis displayed correctly.

### What is deploying in manual test cases and why is it necessary?

Deploying manual test cases means running test cases manually on the application without using any automation tools.  
Manual testing is the process of manually testing software for defects. It requires a tester to play the role of an end user and use most of all features of the application to ensure correct behaviour.  
Manual testing is necessary because it helps find defects that are not easily found through automation.
