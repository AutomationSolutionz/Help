## Description

**What is a Label in test cases?**

A Label is a tag that is assigned to a test case to help organize and categorize it.
Labels are used to represent the actual sensitivity of the content that is labeled.

**Why Labels are necessary for test cases?**

Labels are actually used in software testing and it also helps to organize and categorize test cases.  
However, by assigning labels to test cases, testers can easily identify which test cases are related to each other and which ones are not.  
This helps testers to manage their test cases more efficiently and effectively.
