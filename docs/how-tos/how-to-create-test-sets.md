## Description

### What is a Test Set?

A **Test Set** is a collection of test cases that are grouped together for execution purposes. Test sets are used to organize and execute tests in a logical.

### How Test Set works in automated test cases?

In automated testing, **Test Sets** are used to organize and execute tests in a logical order. **Test Sets** are created by grouping together related tests into a single unit. This allows testers to execute multiple tests at once and ensures that tests are executed in the correct order. Test sets can be created manually or automatically using automation tools.

### What is the importance of Test set?

**Test Sets** are important in software testing because they help to organize test cases and make it easier to manage them. **Test Sets** can be used to group test cases by feature, priority or any other criteria that is relevant to your testing process. This can help to ensure that all test cases are executed and that any issues are detected as soon as possible. Test sets can also be used to track the progress of testing and to identify areas that require additional testing.

### Roles of a Test Set

A **Test Set** serves important roles in software testing. It organizes related test cases, making them easier to manage and execute. It ensures that all relevant test cases are executed together, providing a structured approach to testing. 

The **Test Set** helps achieve test coverage goals and facilities regression testing by including relevant test cases. It aids in test planning, documentation, and reporting, providing valuable insights into test execution progress and results.

Overall, the **Test Set** enhances efficiency, ensures comprehensive testing, and supports effective test management and reporting.

## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Testing** then **Set** option.

2. Go to the **Test Set** page.  
   > Here, the *Test Set* page contains a tab named **All**.  
   A *Test Set* page is a dedicated page that organizes and manages a collection of related test cases, providing an overview and allowing for efficient execution and tracking of multiple tests.  

   > The *All* tab shows the *Search Set* option and the *Sets* which will be searched on *Search Set* bar.

3. Click on the **+ NEW SET** button.  
   > The function of *+ NEW SET* button is to create a new test set, enabling the organization and grouping of test cases for a specific testing scenario or objective.

4. Click and **Enter Set Name**.  
   > *Entering a set name* is necessary to provide a clear and descriptive label for the test set, facilitating easy identification, organization, and reference of the associated test cases.
5. Click on the **OK** button.

6. To add **Test Cases**, click on the required **Set**.  
   > Adding *Test Cases* to a specific *Test Set* is necessary to categorize and group related tests together, ensuring organized execution, tracking, and management of test coverage for specific scenarios or objectives.

7. Click on the **Add** tab of the page. 
8. Select the required **Test Cases**.
9. Click on the **ADD SELECTED** button.  
   > The *Add* tab contains a table which have following informations in the column:
     * **ID**
     * **Title**
     * **Feature**
     * **Folder**
     * **P (Priority**)
     * **Type (Manual or Automated)**
     * **Time**
     * **CR (Created By)**
     * **LM (Last Modified By)**
     * **CRT (Created Time)**
     * **LMT (Last Modified Time)**
     * **LR (Last Run)**
     * **LRS (Last Run Status)**
     * **Edit**
     * **Copy**
     * **Select**.  

    > Selecting required *Test Cases* from a *Test Set* is necessary to focus testing efforts on specific functionalities or areas of the software, optimizing resource utilization and ensuring targeted coverage.  

    > The function of the *ADD SELECTED* button is to include or add the currently selected test cases to the test execution or test plan, allowing for efficient selection and inclusion of desired tests.

10. Click on the **View** tab to see whether the required **Test cases** are added or not.
    > Checking whether the required *Test Cases* are added or not is necessary to ensure that the appropriate test coverage is achieved and no essential scenarios are overlooked.
