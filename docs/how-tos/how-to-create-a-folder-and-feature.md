## Description

### What is a folder?

Similar to folders in your operating system (windows, mac, linux), **Zeuz Folder** is an organizational field provided in ZeuZ so that you can organize their test cases. Users can also create nested folders. You would usually organize your test cases in a folder structure:


Regression
* Desktop
* API
* Mobile
* Web


### What is a feature?

**Features** are similar to folders but they're provided as a separate entity so that you can organize your test cases according to different features/modules of the application under test. Examples include: Login module, Dashboard module, etc. Sub-features can also be created in a nested fashion.

### Why "Folder" and "Feature" are necessary for test cases in software testing?

**Folders** and **Features** are necessary for test cases in software testing to provide organization, context, and better management.

**Folders** help categorize and structure test cases, making it easier to navigate, locate, and trace them based on specific criteria such as modules or test types.

**Features** associate test cases with relevant functionalities, ensuring a clear understanding of what is being tested. They contribute to comprehensive test coverage, prioritization of critical areas, and efficient maintenance of test cases as the software evolves.

Overall, **Folders** and **Features** enhance the organization, effectiveness, and maintainability of test cases in the testing process.
