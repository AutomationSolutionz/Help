## Description

### What is a folder?

Similar to folders in your operating system (windows, mac, linux), Zeuz Folder is an organizational field provided in ZeuZ so that you can organize their test cases. Users can also create nested folders. You would usually organize your test cases in a folder structure:

```
Regression
    |
    |
    --- Desktop
    --- API
    --- Mobile
    --- Web
```

### What is a feature?

Features are similar to folders but they're provided as a separate entity so that you can organize your test cases according to different features/modules of the application under test. Examples include: Login module, Dashboard module, etc. Sub-features can also be created in a nested fashion.
