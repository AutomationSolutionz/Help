|  _QA Milestone_ | _A QA milestone in software testing signifies a significant point of completion or achievement in quality assurance activities to ensure the desired level of software quality._  |
| _Training Task Milestone_  | _A training task milestone in software testing represents a significant point in the training process where specific training activities or objectives related to testing are completed._  |
| _Practice Milestone_  |  _A practice milestone in software testing signifies a significant point in the testing process where testing techniques, methodologies, or skills are practiced and applied successfully._ |
|  _Test Milestone_ |_A test milestone in software testing refers to a significant point in the testing process that marks the completion of a specific set of tests or the achievement of a testing objective._   |
| _Backlog Milestone_  | _A backlog milestone in software testing represents a significant point in the testing process where a specific backlog of testing tasks or defects is addressed and resolved._  |

## Owner

In software testing, the **Owner** refers to the individual or team responsible for overseeing and managing the testing activities, ensuring quality, and coordinating with stakeholders.

## Description

In software testing, the **Description** refers to a concise and clear explanation of the purpose, scope, and details of a test case or test scenario.

## Feature

In software testing, a **Feature** refers to a distinct functionality or capability of a software system that is tested individually to ensure its proper functioning.

## Label

In software testing, a **Label** refers to a descriptive tag or identifier assigned to a test case, test suit, or defect, providing a way to categorize and organize them based on specific criteria or attributes.

## Priority

In software testing, **Priority** refers to the relative importance or urgency assigned to a defect, test case, or requirement, indicating the order in which it should be addressed or executed based on its significance.

### Different types of Possible Priorities

| Priority  |  Description |
|---|---|
| *P1*  | *P1 priority in software testing denotes the highest level of urgency and criticality assigned to a defect, test case, or requirement that requires immediate attention and resolution.*  |
| *P2*   | *P2 priority typically refers to a high level of urgency and importance assigned to a defect, test case, or requirement, indicating that it should be addressed promptly but with a slightly lower level of urgency compared to P1 priority items.*  |
| *P3*  | *P3 priority typically refers to a moderate level of urgency and importance assigned to a defect, test case, or requirement, indicating that it should be addressed in a timely manner, but with a lower level of urgency compare to P1 and P2 priority items.*  |
| *P4*  |  *P4 priority typically refers to a low lever of urgency and importance assigned to a defect, test case, or requirement, indicating that it can be addressed with a lower priority compared to P1, P2, and P3 priority items.* |

## Start Date

In software testing, the **Start Date** refers to the planned or actual date on which a particular testing activity, phase, or test execution period is scheduled to begin.

## End date

In software testing, the **End Date** refers to the planned or actual date on which a particular testing activity, phase, or test execution period is expected to be completed or has been completed.
