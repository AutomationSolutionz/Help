## Description

### What is Deploy in test cases and why is it necessary?

Deployment in ZeuZ is the process of selecting one or more *Test Cases*
or a *Test Set* and deploying them to a ZeuZ Node.

Users also have the ability to configure reporting capabilities such as
who to send email reports to, which platforms
(Slack/Teams/Discord/Mattermost), etc.

:::tip

You can deploy hundreds or even thousands of test cases at a time!

## Steps

1. Go to the **Run Tests/Deploy** page first.  
2. Click on the **Search Test Cases** and **Search** button to select a test case.  
   > The purpose of the *Run Tests/Deploy* page is to execute test cases and deploy the tested application for validation and release.

   > The function of *Search Test Cases* and the *Search* button is to quickly find specific test cases based on specified criteria or keywords, facilitating test case management and execution.

3. Fill up the **Information**  
4. And select the **Browser** and **Mobile** which is under **Platform**.
   > The necessity of filling up the *Information* is to ensure clear and comprehensive documentation of the testing process, enabling accurate replication and effective communication among team members.

   > **Assigned Testers**: The meaning of *Assign Testers* is to allocate specific individuals or team members to be responsible for executing and validating the designated test cases.  
   > **Send Report to**: The meaning of *Send report to* is to specify the recipent(s) or stakeholders who will receive the testing results and findings.  
   > **Milestone**: The meaning of *Milestone* is a significant point or event in the testing process that represents progress, achievement, or completion of specific objectives.  
   > **Run Objective**: *Run Objective* refers to the specific goal or purpose of executing a set of test cases or a testing cycle.  
   > **Version**: *Version* refers to a specific release or iteration of a software product that is being tested to identify and resolve issues or improvements.  

   > The function of *Platform* is to specify the target operating system, device, or environment on which the test cases will be executed to ensure compatibility and accurate validation.  

   > It is necessary to select *Browser* and *Mobile* platforms to ensure comprehensive test coverage across different devices and environments used by end-users.

5. Multiple of **Assign testers** and **Send report to** can be selected.  
6. Besides, multiple of **Milestone**, **Run Objective** and **Version** cannot be selected.  
   > Multiple selections of *Assign Testers* and *Send Report to* allow for effective distribution of testing responsibilities among team members and sharing testing results with relevant stakeholders. This ensures better collaboration and communication within the testing process.

   > Multiple selections of *Milestone*, *Run Objective*, and *Version* cannot be choosen to maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity in associating test cases with specific progress points, goals, and software releases.

8. Then select the **Machine** and click on the **Deploy** button.  
   > It is necessary to select the *Machine* to specify the target hardware environment where the test cases will be executed, ensuring consistent and controlled testing conditions.

   > The function of *Deploy* button is to initiate the installation or release of a software application or a specific version to the designated testing environment.
