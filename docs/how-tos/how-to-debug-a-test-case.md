Debugging in automated test cases is the process of identifying and removing errors from software applications using automated testing tools.

Debugging is necessary because it helps to identify and fix defects in the system.

Debugging is crucial for writing clean code, minimizing errors, and creating top-quality software as a result. Any successful program requires hours of debugging to make it behave as expected.
