## Description

### Why is it necessary to add new actions above or below a dataset?

Adding new actions above or below a dataset is necessary to maintain the sequence and flow of test case steps while accomodating changes or additions, ensuring accurate and consistent test case execution and validation.

### What is the purpose of adding new actions above or below a dataset?

The purpose of adding new actions above or below a dataset in software testing is to extend or modify the sequence of test case steps while maintaining the logical flow, enabling testers to include additional actions or adjust the test scenario to effectively validate software functionality.

## Steps

1. From the **Menu Bar**, go to the **Testing** then **Set** option.

2. Go to the **Test Set** page.
   > The *Test Set* page contain the following informations in the column of the table:
     * **Name**: *Name* refers to a descriptive label or identifier given to a collection of related test cases.  
     * **Created By**: *Created By* refers to the individual or entity responsible for initiating and generating the test set.  
     * **Created Date**: *Created Date* refers to the timestamp indicating when the test set was initially generated or created.  
     * **Number of Test Cases**: *Number of Test Cases* refers to the count of individual test cases included within the specific test set.  
     * **Time**: *Time* refers to the duration or estimated time required to execute all test cases within the test set.  
     * **Edit Order**: *Edit Order* refers to the capability to rearrange the sequence or order of included test cases within the test set.  
     * **Deploy**: *Deploy* refers to the action of initiating the execution of the test cases included in the test set.  
     * **Delete**: *Delete* refers to the action of parmanently removing a specific test set from the testing environment or management system.
