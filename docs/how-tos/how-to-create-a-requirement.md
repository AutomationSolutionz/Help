## Description

### What is a Requirement in software testing?

In software testing, **Requirements** are specific functions, features, or capabilities that the software must have. They serve as foundation for testing by guiding test coverage, design, evaluation, and traceability.  

**Requirements** validate and verify the software's behaviour and support change management. By using requirements effectively, testers ensure that the software meets expectations and satisfies stakeholders.  

**Requirements** serve as the foundation for the software development and testing proccesses, outlining the expectations and criteria for the software's behaviour, performance and quality. They are typically documented in a requirements specification or a functional requirements document.  

### What is the importance of Requirement in software testing?

**Requirements** are highly important in software testing for several reasons. 
* They provide clear objectives and goals for testing, ensuring that testers have a well-defined focus.
* **Requirements** guide test coverage, helping testers identify what functionalities and areas need to be tested.
* They serve as a benchmark for evaluating the actual behaviour of the software during testing and enable traceability between requirements and test cases.
* **Requirements** also support effective communication among stakeholders and assist in managing changes in the software.  

Ultimately, **Requirements** ensure that the software meets expectations, performs as intended, and satisfies the need of stakeholders.
